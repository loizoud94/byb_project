# byb_project

This is a basic exercise to demonstrate my ability to push a Git repository to GitHub. The project includes a simple file named `helloWorld.py`, which I have edited a couple of times before committing.

## Usage

Run the `helloWorld.py` file in any Python interpreter.

Feel free to explore and use this project as a starting point for more complex exercises or projects.

Happy coding!
